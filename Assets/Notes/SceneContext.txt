Scene Context
- singleton
- Instantiates and Stores references to Factories. Expose Factories publicly as properties, to lazily instantiate them 
- Is specfic. ie. If writing a test scene, that scene should have its own SceneContext
	

Factory<T>
	- Examples: SheepDogFactory, SheepFactory <SheepFacade>
	- Create
	
Spawn : Monobehaviour
	- Examples: SheepDogSpawn, SheepSpawn
	- Initialize
		- SceneContext.instance.<T>factory
	- Spawn
		- calls <T>factory.Create()
		- think about whether new instances inherit transform
