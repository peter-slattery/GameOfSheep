## Setup

<a name="unity_information"></a>
### Unity Information
**Version:** Unity 5.6 (Currently in Beta)

<a name="tools"></a>
### Tools
**UnityYAMLMerge**<br>
[Information on setting up UnityYAMLMerge](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SmartMerge.html) is here.
We found that this wasn't super helpful in setting it up. [The walkthrough we used is here](http://kihira.uk/unity-and-git-getting-them-to-play-nicely/).
*Note: The walkthrough is for windows. Make sure you change the paths accordingly, and either remove the `.exe` extentions, or change them to `.app`*

**KDiff3**<br>
In the process of setting up UnityYAMLMerge, we decided to use KDiff3 as our backup. [KDiff3 is here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/kdiff3/files/)<br>
*Note: You need to put the KDiff3.app file in `Applications/KDiff3'*
